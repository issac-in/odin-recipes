        <h1>Steak Burrito Bowl</h1>
        <img src="../../assets/images/steak-burrito-bowl.jpg" alt="Steak burrito bowl on a wood board.">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Inspired directly from Chipotle, this homemade version of the double steak burrito bowl is cheaper, better tasting, and has more protein.</p>
        <p>Additionally, like a Chipotle's burrito bowl, we will prepare the individual components of the bowl then combine them at the end.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Steak</h3>
                <p>Prepare the steak: cut the chuck roast <strong>(~900 grams (2 lb))</strong> into 1 inch cubes, and put into a zip-loc bag along with salt <strong>(a sprinkle)</strong>, cumin <strong>(a sprinkle)</strong>, and paprika <strong>(a sprinkle)</strong>. Seal the zip-loc bag with some air in it, then mix & massage the steak and spices together.</p>
                <p>Sear and season the steak: take a portion of the steak cubes to a medium-high heat griddle. The steak should have enough fat on its own to render out and cook. Leave it on the griddle for 3-4 minutes or until it browns.</p>
                <p>Finish & adjust: Add lime juice <strong>(a spritz)</strong> for acid. Taste and adjust with more lime, salt, or seasoning.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Mexican Rice</h3>
                <p>Toast the rice & aromatics: heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the cooking oil <strong>(5 grams (a drizzle))</strong>, chicken bouillon powder <strong>(12 grams (a spoonful))</strong>, minced garlic <strong>(1/2 of it)</strong>, and minced serrano pepper <strong>(1/2 of it)</strong>, and let them bloom for 30 seconds. Then, add the diced roma tomato <strong>(all of it)</strong> and saute for 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Add the rice <strong>(160 grams)</strong> and toast for 2 minutes until there are little char marks on the exterior of the grains or the rice smells toasty.</p>
                <p>Add the water <strong>(250 grams)</strong> to deglaze the pan, then bring the mixture to a boil for 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer covered with a towel and lid for 25 minutes or until the moisture has been absorbed and the rice is cooked through.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Corn Salsa</h3>
                <p>Prep the corn: remove the husks from the corn <strong>(2 ears)</strong> and cook them on a griddle, grill, or gas flame over medium heat until charred. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Once the corn is toasted, slice off the kernels.</p>
                <p>Mix the salsa: add the corn, diced shallots <strong>(all of it)</strong>, and cilantro stems <strong>(1/2 of a bunch)</strong> to the container. Add salt <strong>(to taste)</strong> and lime juice <strong>(a splash)</strong> and shake together. Let it sit for a few minutes to marinate for better flavor until ready to serve.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Beans</h3>
                <p>Heat a pan over medium heat, then add the cooking oil <strong>(5 grams (a drizzle))</strong>, minced serrano peppers <strong>(1/2 of it)</strong>, and minced garlic <strong>(1/2 of it)</strong> to bloom for two minutes.</p>
                <p>Pour in the entire container of black beans <strong>(400 grams (14 oz can))</strong> and let it simmer. Add salt <strong>(to taste)</strong> and smoked paprika <strong>(a sprinkle)</strong>. Let it simmer for another 2 minutes to reduce excess liquid. When the beans are cooked to your liking, taste & adjust the seasoning (if needed), and then set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cilantro Avocado Crema</h3>
                <p>To a blender or food processor, add the low-fat sour cream <strong>(150 grams)</strong>, ripe avocado <strong>(all of it)</strong>, cilantro <strong>(1/2 of a bunch)</strong>, adobo seasoning <strong>(a sprinkle)</strong>, and lime juice <strong>(a splash)</strong>. Pulse to combine. Taste and adjust as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Assemble & serve</h3>
                <p>To a warm bowl, add heated beans, mexican rice, and steak, followed by the corn salsa, cilantro avocado crema, thinly sliced lettuce <strong>(1/4 of it)</strong>, and grated pepper jack cheese <strong>(as desired)</strong>.</p>
            </li>
