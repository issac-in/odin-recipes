# Yoinked Recipes
## What is this?
The 1st project of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.

It's a HTML / CSS build of a basic recipe website.

## What skills will I have demonstrated through this?
HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, etc.

## Why Yoinked?
Because I 'yoinked' all of these recipes from other creators on the Internet.

(All creators are cited on their relevant recipe pages.)

## What features would I like to add in the future?
Features that are possible with JavaScript:
 - Responsive design based on viewport
 - Jump back to top
 - Sticky header & navigation
 - Dynamically changing header backgrounds
 - On hover / on click changes
